/**
 * Brazilian non-geographic and service phone numbering.
 *
 * The Regulamento de Numeração dos Serviços de Telecomunicações (Resolução Anatel nº 749/2022,
 * which replaced the revoked Resolução nº 553/2010) defines two separate families, plus a third
 * one that is only a market convention:
 *
 * - **Código Não Geográfico (CNG)**, art. 18: a 10-digit code in the `300`, `303`, `500`, `800`
 *   or `900` series, dialed with the Prefixo Nacional `0` in front (art. 28), so 11 digits in
 *   total and never a DDD. `800` is toll-free for the caller, `300` and `303` split the cost
 *   (`303` marks subscribers that generate call bursts, such as telemarketing), `500` is for
 *   donation campaigns by non-profits and `900` for paid value-added services. The 10-digit
 *   `0800` + 6 form is extinct: Resolução nº 709/2019 art. 2º ordered every CNG migrated to the
 *   11-digit format. `900` is currently held in reserva técnica (Ato nº 12.712/2024, item 12.1),
 *   and `500` encodes the donation amount in its last two digits (item 10.6), a rule this
 *   library does not enforce, since it validates structure only.
 * - **Código de Acesso a Serviços de Utilidade Pública (SUP)**, art. 13-14: 3 digits, with the
 *   whole `1N₂N₁` range destined to SUP and every other 3-digit series held in reserva técnica.
 *   Individual codes are designated one by one by Anatel Ato, so the codes below are the
 *   consolidated list Anatel publishes, not the full `100`-`199` range. `112` and `911` are
 *   mobile-only aliases of `190` and are listed by Anatel alongside the `1XX` codes.
 * - **The abbreviated `300X`/`400X` numbers** (`3003-1234`, `4004-1234`) are *not* a regulatory
 *   category at all. They are ordinary 8-digit geographic STFC user numbers (art. 11 assigns
 *   `2`-`6` as the first digit of a fixed-line number) whose 4-digit prefix a carrier licenses
 *   in many DDDs at once and points at a single customer, marketed as "Número Único". Anatel
 *   neither names them nor publishes an allocated list, so the roots below are the conventional
 *   ones rather than an official allocation.
 *
 * Display formatting is convention too: no Anatel document specifies one. `0800 123 4567` (4-3-4)
 * is the grouping used on gov.br, and `4004-1234` the one carriers print.
